# Guacamole_Tools
 A small set of tools for securely installing Guacamole

1) Securely updates properties file (Not for managing users and connections)
2) Securely updates guacadmin's password from default password in installation sql scripts for MySQL.

Download the code, compile and run! Interactive Console based tool.

For now, have no plans of adding features for managing users / connections.
